        <h2> A slice of toast between two slices of bread for reasons.</h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 slices of bread</li>
            <li>1 slice of toasted bread</li>
             <li>Some butter. Or, more likely, the world's worst margarine</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>You should already have toasted some bread. If not, do that now, while questioning your life choices in following this recipe</li>
            <li>Butter the bread. Or put the thinnest layer of margarine possible across it</li>
            <li>Put toast between slices of bread</li>
            <li>Eat before the last traces of warmth have gone. From the sandwich and your soul</li>
        </ol>
